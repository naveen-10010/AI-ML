# Malware Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on proactive malware detection in Portable Executable (PE) files, particularly EXE, DLL, and BAT formats. The detection system is based on static analysis and employs machine learning models to classify files as benign or malicious without requiring an internet connection.

## Features
- **Static Analysis**: Extracts features from PE files without execution.
- **Machine Learning-Based Detection**: Uses trained models to identify malware.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **Standalone Application**: No internet connection required for detection.
- **User Interface**: Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for easy interaction.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Required Python libraries:
  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Feature extraction tools (such as `pefile` for PE file parsing)

### Running the Application
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/saikartiksharma/malware_detection.git
   cd malware_detection
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Flask backend:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

## Model Details
The machine learning model is trained using a dataset of benign and malicious PE files. The model is optimized for accuracy and resource efficiency to enable real-time detection.

### Features Used
- File header characteristics
- Section entropy
- Imported/exported functions
- Strings and opcode frequency

### Model Used
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM) with RBF Kernel** (selected for its high accuracy and performance in malware classification)

## Usage
1. Upload a PE file through the web interface.
2. The system extracts features and runs the ML model.
3. The result is displayed: **Benign** or **Malicious**.

## Deployment
This application can be deployed as a standalone tool or integrated into larger security frameworks. The model and feature extraction components are optimized to run efficiently on local systems without cloud dependency.

## Future Enhancements
- **Dynamic Analysis Integration**: Complement static analysis with behavioral insights.
- **Threat Intelligence Updates**: Extend the model with real-time malware signature updates.
- **Automated Feature Selection**: Improve feature extraction using advanced techniques.
